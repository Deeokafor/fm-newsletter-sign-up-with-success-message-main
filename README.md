## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Add their email and submit the form
- See a success message with their email after successfully submitting the form
- See form validation messages if:
  - The field is left empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - css utility-first framework
- ES6 (Javascript version 2015)


### What I learned

- I had to refresh my memory on how html & css file paths worked. I had to learn that using relative paths is more production friendly than absolute paths... a change in directory could cause paths to fail.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own plans for continued development.**

### Useful resources

- [w3docs](https://www.w3docs.com) - Their tutorial on adjusting the positions of custom list styles was helpful. You can check it out at [How to Adjust the Position of List Style Image](https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/css/how-to-adjust-the-position-of-list-style-image.html)

- [css-tricks](https://css-tricks.com/quick-reminder-about-file-paths/) - Their short tutorial on fixed and relative filepaths was super helpful in debugging a file path issue I had with Tailwindcss. You can check it out at [Quick Reminder About File Paths](https://css-tricks.com/quick-reminder-about-file-paths/)

- [github mkdocs](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/issues/1757) - the discussions held by these helpful fellows on how github pages using the MkDocs handles file paths in production was super helpful to debug my path failure issues. You can check them out at [ Image paths can break when deploying to gh-pages #1757 ](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/issues/1757)
